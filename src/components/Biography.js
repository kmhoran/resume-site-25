      <p>Hello and welcome to my website!</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm Kevin Horan, a backend software engineer with nearly a decade of
        experience in designing, building, and optimizing scalable cloud-native
        systems. My journey into software development began during my freshman
        year at UC Irvine, where a programming course sparked my interest. That
        interest quickly turned into passion when I wrote a script during an
        internship to update 100,000 files in no time, a task my manager had
        expected to take me weeks. That moment solidified my love for the power
        of solving complex problems with elegant code, and I knew this was the
        career for me.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After graduating, I continued into the world of software development. I
        stuck to building apps and sites for myself and my friends. My first
        true development role at Quote Mule marked a major turning point in my
        career. I went from a hobbyist working on personal projects to tackling
        the challenges of professional software engineering. Learning new
        technologies like C# and AngularJS under tight sprint deadlines and
        delivering features that would impact thousands of users was a grind,
        but it was also the moment I realized my potential as a professional
        developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Over the years, I've continued to evolve, embracing new technologies and
        solving complex problems in a variety of industries, including
        e-commerce, aerospace, and entertainment. Currently, I work as an SDE II
        at Amazon Prime Video, where I lead a talented team of engineers to
        design and deploy services that handle millions of updates per day. I've
        been part of large-scale transformations, like migrating from legacy
        architectures to modern AWS solutions, reducing operational costs by
        35%. I'm proud to say that I'm also known as a bar-raising
        mentor—guiding junior engineers and interns as they shape their careers
        in tech.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mentorship is a big part of my philosophy. I believe in sharing
        knowledge and fostering collaboration, both in formal mentorship roles
        and in day-to-day interactions. The development of others isn't just a
        duty—it's an opportunity to help shape better products and stronger
        teams.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I've worked on everything from championing
        microservice architecture that enabled real-time publication systems to
        leading the development of e-commerce dashboards that increased sales
        revenue by 20%. I've had the privilege of working with a wide range of
        technologies including AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and Java to name a
        few. My technical skill set is as diverse as my experience, but I always
        prioritize writing clean, maintainable code that solves real-world
        problems efficiently.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What motivates me most is the thrill of solving puzzles. Whether it's
        optimizing a complex system or building something new, I love the
        challenge and satisfaction of making something work that others thought
        wasn't possible. For me, it's all about delivering high-impact solutions
        while keeping things simple, efficient, and easy to maintain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work,
        feel free to explore my portfolio or reach out to me directly. I'm
        always looking for opportunities to innovate, mentor, and drive
        impactful change.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Let's build something great together!</p>
